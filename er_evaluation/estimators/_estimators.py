    Design estimator for pairwise precision.

    Given a predicted disambiguation `prediction`, a set of ground truth clusters `sample`, and a set of cluster sampling weights `weights` (e.g., inverse probability weights for each cluster), this returns a pairwise precision estimate together with its estimated standard deviation.

    Note:
        This is the precision estimator corresponding to cluster block sampling in [1].

    Args:
        prediction (Series): Membership vector indexed by cluster elements and with values corresponding to associated cluster identifier.
        sample (Series): Membership vector indexed by cluster elements and with values corresponding to associated cluster identifier.
        weights (Series): Pandas Series indexed by cluster identifier and with values corresponding to cluster sampling weights (e.g., inverse sampling probabilities). Can also be the string "uniform" for uniform sampling weights, or "cluster_size" for inverse cluster size sampling weights.

    Returns:
        tuple: Precision estimate and standard deviation estimate.

    Examples:
        >>> prediction = pd.Series(index=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], data=[1,1,2,3,2,4,4,4])
