üîç ER-Evaluation: An End-to-End Evaluation Framework for Entity Resolution Systems
==================================================================================

**ER-Evaluation** is a Python package for the evaluation of entity resolution (ER) systems. It provides data structure definitions, summary statistics, visualizations, error analysis tools, and statistically principled performance estimators.

Installation
------------

Install the released version from PyPI using:

.. code:: bash

    pip install er-evaluation


Documentation
-------------

Please refer to the documentation website `olivierbinette.ca/er-evaluation <http://olivierbinette.ca/er-evaluation/build/html/index.html>`_.
